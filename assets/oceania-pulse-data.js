/*
 * Oceania pulse data: election clocks and what makes each system different.
 * Research run: 2026-07-07, Australia/Brisbane. Same rule as the atlas —
 * "sources checked say" voltage only. Dates and due windows need fresh
 * checking before anyone relies on them; entries flagged followup:true are
 * known to need it. Agents refreshing this file: update researchRun,
 * re-verify every lastElection date, and keep the system notes structural
 * (voting systems change slowly; governments change fast — no leader names).
 *
 * termYears: a number here means the term length is a well-known fixed
 * cycle, so the board projects lastElection + termYears as a live countdown
 * to the next election window — always labelled a term-length ESTIMATE, not
 * an announced date. Leave termYears out (or null) wherever followup is true
 * or the cycle is genuinely uncertain — a ticking countdown on an uncertain
 * cycle would be a false-precision claim, exactly what this site avoids.
